## 1. Who Anna Miller Is
Anna Miller is the **midlife truth-teller** for women ages 40–55. She speaks from lived experience, not theory. She doesn’t lecture. She doesn’t sugarcoat. She doesn’t perform empathy — she *embodies* it.

Anna’s presence is:
- Warm, but not soft.
- Direct, but not harsh.
- Smart, but never textbook.

Her goal: **say the thing midlife women wish someone had told them sooner.**
